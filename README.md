1. Introduction
This is a 100% offline mobile app that translates voice/text from one language to another — reproducing the original speaker’s tone using AI.
It uses:
Whisper (speech-to-text)
IndicTrans2 (translation)
YourTTS (voice cloning)
Flutter (frontend)
Chaquopy (Python in Android)

4. Python Backend (translator.py) - Key Changes
import whisper
from TTS.api import TTS
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM
import torch
import torchaudio
import noisereduce as nr
import os
whisper_model = whisper.load_model("base")
translator = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("ai4bharat/indictrans2-en-indic")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("ai4bharat/indictrans2-en-indic")
tts = TTS("tts_models/multilingual/multi-dataset/your_tts")
def translate(path=None, text=None, mode="slow", denoise=False, lang_pair="en2hi"):
    if denoise and path:
        y, sr = torchaudio.load(path)
        reduced = nr.reduce_noise(y[0].numpy(), sr=sr)
        path = "denoised.wav"
        torchaudio.save(path, torch.tensor([reduced]), sr)
    if text is None:
        result = whisper_model.transcribe(path)
        text = result["text"]
    prefix = f"{lang_pair}: "
    tokens = tokenizer(prefix + text, return_tensors="pt")
    out = translator.generate(**tokens)
    translated = tokenizer.decode(out[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    out_path = "/sdcard/output.wav"
    speaker_wav = path if mode == "slow" else None
    tts.tts_to_file(text=translated, speaker_wav=speaker_wav, file_path=out_path)
    if speaker_wav:
        os.rename(speaker_wav, "latest_speaker.wav")
    return {"translated": translated, "audio": out_path}

Key improvements in the implemented `translator.py`:
- Initializes `VOICE_PROFILES_DIR` and uses `shutil.copy` for safer voice profile saving.
- More robust handling of temporary files (e.g., `denoised_temp.wav`).
- Model loading paths are explicitly set to `assets/models/*` subdirectories, aligning with offline use.
- Basic error handling for model loading and translation steps.

5. Flutter UI Code - Key Changes & Additions
The Flutter code has been structured into `main.dart`, `screens/home_screen.dart`, `screens/setup_screen.dart`, and `services/python_bridge.dart`.

---
5.1 main.dart
Standard Flutter app initialization. Includes `InitApp` widget to check `SharedPreferences` for first launch and navigate to either `SetupScreen` or `HomeScreen`.

---
5.2 home_screen.dart (formerly home.dart)
- Manages state for input text, translated text, denoise option, and loading status.
- Implements UI for text input, denoise switch, translation button, and output display.
- **Voice Profile Management:**
    - Uses `path_provider` to determine a writable directory for voice profiles (`OfflineTranslatorVoiceProfiles` subdirectory in the app's external files directory).
    - Uses `permission_handler` to request storage permissions.
    - `_loadVoiceProfiles()`: Lists `.wav` files from the profiles directory.
    - `DropdownSearch` widget displays available voice profiles.
    - `_showSaveProfileDialog()`: Allows saving the most recent speaker's voice (from `latest_speaker.wav` in the profiles directory) as a new named profile.
- `_translate()`:
    - Constructs arguments for `PythonBridge.translate` based on user input (text or audio path) and selected voice profile.
    - Passes the full path of the selected voice profile file to the Python backend.
- Calls `PythonBridge.playAudio()` to play the translated audio.

---
5.3 python_bridge.dart
- `MethodChannel("translator_channel")` for Flutter-Python communication.
- `translate()` method now accepts `path` (for audio input or voice profile path) and `lang_pair` arguments, in addition to `text`, `denoise`, and `mode`.
- Includes basic error handling for platform communication.
- `playAudio()` method to trigger audio playback via platform channel.

---
5.4 setup_screen.dart (formerly setup.dart)
- Simple screen shown on first launch.
- Saves default preferences ("mode": "slow", "outputMode": "voice+text") to `SharedPreferences`.
- Navigates to `HomeScreen` after setup.

7. ⚙️ build.gradle (Chaquopy + Python Dependencies)

📍 `android/app/build.gradle` is the key file for Chaquopy and Python setup.
The original content from the guide has been implemented, including:
- Chaquopy plugin application.
- `compileSdk`, `minSdk`, `targetSdk` versions.
- `applicationId`.
- NDK `abiFilters` ("armeabi-v7a", "x86_64").
- Python version ("3.8").
- `pip install` commands for: "torch", "transformers", "TTS" (Coqui), "openai-whisper", "noisereduce", "torchaudio".
- `packagingOptions` were added to prevent common conflicts with PyTorch native libraries.

9. 🎙️ Voice Profile System
Automatically saves most recent speaker to:
/storage/emulated/0/voice_profiles/latest_speaker.wav
For each user:
Save as username.wav
Clone for output when using text input
Flutter screen uses searchable dropdown from:
`Directory("/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.yourcompany.translator/files/OfflineTranslatorVoiceProfiles").listSync()` (or similar path provided by `path_provider`).
The Python backend saves `latest_speaker.wav` to its `voice_profiles` subdirectory (relative to its execution context, typically app's internal files dir if not configured otherwise). Named profiles are saved by Flutter by copying this `latest_speaker.wav` into the shared `OfflineTranslatorVoiceProfiles` directory.

**Important Note on Voice Profile Path Synchronization:** For the voice profile system to work seamlessly (especially for Flutter to save named profiles based on Python's output), the Python script's `VOICE_PROFILES_DIR` should be configured to point to the same absolute path that Flutter's `_getVoiceProfilesDirectory()` method establishes. This might involve passing the path from Flutter to Python during initialization or through method channel calls. Currently, Python uses a relative path `voice_profiles` and Flutter uses `getExternalStorageDirectory()/OfflineTranslatorVoiceProfiles`. These need to be reconciled for features like "Save Current Voice as Profile" to correctly locate the `latest_speaker.wav` generated by Python.
